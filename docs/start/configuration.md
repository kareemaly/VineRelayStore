Environment variables
----------------

# Development environment
If you are running this app in your local machine you can create `.env` file and add your env. variables in it and both the graphql server and frontend server will read from it.

You dont need to worry about your env. variables being exposed when you push to your repository because `.env` file is ignored.

# Production environment
Only configure env. variables on your production server.
